#  AI & The Future â€“ Reddit Scraping & Text Analysis

##  Project Topic:
**Will AI Take Over the World?**  
This project explores Reddit discussions surrounding the future of Artificial Intelligence, including public fears, hopes, and predictions about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and AI takeover.

---

##  Part 1: Web Scraping

- Scraped 100+ Reddit posts using keywords:
  - `"AI takeover"`
  - `"AGI"`
  - `"AI future"`
- Used Reddit's public JSON API with `requests` + `pandas`
- Filtered out empty or very short content
- Posts were pulled from `r/artificial`

###  Scraping Tools Compared:

| Criteria        | BeautifulSoup + Requests       | Playwright (Headless Browser)     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ease of Setup  |  Simple Python-only setup       |  Requires Node.js               |
| Speed          |  Fast (<3 seconds for 100 posts)|  Slow (~10s per post)           |
| Use Case       |  Perfect for API/static pages   |  Needed for JavaScript-heavy    |
| Benchmark Used |  Yes (Reddit API)               |  No                             |
| Chosen?        |  Yes                            |  No                             |

## ðŸ¤– Part 2: Text Analysis using Mistral (LLM)

- Used **Mistral 7B** via **Ollama (local LLM server)**
- Each post was analyzed for:
  1. **2â€“3 sentence summary**
  2. **Impact score** (-10 to +10)
  3. **Tone** â€“ Hopeful or Fearful

###  Sample Prompt:
```
You are an AI analyst. Analyze the following Reddit post about the future of AI and humanity:

POST:

Tasks:
1. Give a 2â€“3 sentence summary.
2. Assign a score from -10 (very dangerous) to +10 (very beneficial).
3. Classify tone as Hopeful or Fearful.

Return in this exact format:
